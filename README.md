# Doodledraftüé®: A Simplified [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) Clone

Doodledraft is a React-based application that serves as a basic clone of the popular online whiteboarding tool, [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw). Designed to showcase frontend development skills, particularly in React, this project offers a simplified version of a collaborative drawing and diagramming web app.

### Technology Stack Highlights

- **React & Next.js**: Utilizes React for building the user interface, with Next.js for server-side rendering and routing.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Implements WebSocket via Socket.io to allow real-time collaboration, simulating multi-user drawing experiences across different browser tabs.
- **State Management**: Employs Redux Toolkit for efficient state management across React components.
- **Styling & Icons**: Integrates Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and Font Awesome for a wide range of icons.
- **Canvas API**: Leverages the HTML5 Canvas API for drawing and rendering graphical elements.

Doodledraft is an attempt to replicate the seamless drawing experience of Excalidraw while demonstrating significant web development concepts and technologies. Whether you're sketching diagrams, doodling, or collaborating in real-time, Doodledraft aims to provide a straightforward yet powerful drawing tool.
